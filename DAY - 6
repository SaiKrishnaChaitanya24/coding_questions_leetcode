question 1 .
here is encoding and decoding question- 
Copy the below paragraph and write an ecoded text file then read the same file and reconstruct the original paragraph. You have to use $f(a)$ function for encoding and decoding the text. $f(a) = 2a + 3$,where $a$ is an **ASCII** value of charater.
Data science is an inter-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. Data science is related to data mining and big data. Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine learning and their related methods" in order to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data. It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, and information science. Turing award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a "fourth paradigm" of science (empirical, theoretical, computational and now data-driven) and asserted that "everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology" and the data deluge. In 2015, the American Statistical Association identified database management, statistics and machine learning, and distributed and parallel systems as the three emerging foundational professional communities.

question 2 -
Using below text, write a file named File_1.txt and you have to insert new line character after every 10 words.

code is as follows -

question 3-
Create a dictionary, with **keys** should be the number from 1 to 100 (1 and 100 both inclusive) and the value should be the list of string representing whether that key is **'Prime'**, **'Fibonacci'** (if that number exist in Fibonacci sequence), **'Square'** or all of three. Also write a function which accepts a dictionary (which you will create) and string **Prime**, **Fibonacci** or **Square** and by searching through dictionary it should return a tuple of that numbers. 
For ex:
sample_dict = {1: ['Fibonacci', 'Square'], 6: [], ..., 13: ['Prime', 'Fibonacci'], ..., 34: ['Fibonacci'], ..., 100: ['Square']}
For second part of the question:
seq = func_name('Fibonacci')
print(seq) --> (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ..., 89)

code is as follows-
fibonacci = []
a = 1 
b = 1
fibonacci.append(a)
fibonacci.append(b)
c = 0
while c < 100:
  c = a + b
  fibonacci.append(c)
  a = b
  b = c
is_prime = []
start_val = 1
for num in range(1, 100+1):
    if(num>1):
        for i in range(2,num):
            if(num%i)==0:
                is_prime.append(num)
num_dict = {}
for i in range(1, 101):
  if i not in num_dict:
      num_dict[i] = []
  if i**2 <= 100:
      num_dict[i**2] = []
      num_dict[i**2].append('Square')
  if i in fibonacci:
      num_dict[i].append('Fibonacci')
  if i in is_prime:
      num_dict[i].append('Prime')
print(num_dict)
